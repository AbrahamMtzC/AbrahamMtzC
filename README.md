- 👋 Hi, I’m @AbrahamMtzC, but you can call me Deimos or Deadmos. Im 21, i currently live on Durango Dgo. Mexico

- 👀 I’m interested in videogames, music, fitness and other things that i cant thing of rn. 

- 🌱 Im currently studying software engineering in Instituto Tecnologico de Durango, i don't consider myself a professional. But i can be a part of a team, and learn a lot during any project. I also really like to learn new stuff and i always consider constructive criticism as a way to be better on everything.

- ✨ I consider myself as a really creative person. Sinse i was a kid, i really enjoyed creating my own stories while i played with my toys. Since then i realice that im more into tell my stories rather than written them down, due to my ease to came out with more stuff on the go. Im a perfectionist. Since i was a kid, i was teached to do everything as perfect as posible, or rather dont do it. This made me look for the best results on my tasks, and never be conformed with a "good enough".

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate as a web developer (full stack), videogame developement, mobile app developement.
